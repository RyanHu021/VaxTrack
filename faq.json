				{
					"question": "Q: Why do you need my vaccination record card?",
					"answer": "A: We require users to upload their vaccination record cards to ensure authenticity. We will never collect your data for any purposes other than to show your supervisors."
				},
				{
					"question": "Q: What are you doing with my vaccination record card?",
					"answer": "A: When you upload your vaccination record card, we scan it one time using an optical character recognition system to check for your name and determine your vaccine type. It is then stored securely on our database, which is not publicly accessible. Only you and your group supervisors will be able to view it."
				},
				{
					"question": "Q: Why can't I upload a photo of my vaccination record card?",
					"answer": "A: Please ensure that the photo is either a .jpg, .png, or .gif file. If it is not, there are widely available online photo converters to reach the desired format."
				},
                {
					"question": "Q: Why do I keep getting asked to retake my photo?",
					"answer": "A: Please ensure that your photo is taken similarly to the example. Have good lighting and minimize motion blur. If the problem persists, please contact your supervisor for assistance."
				},
                {
					"question": "Q: The vaccination information is wrong. How do I fix it?",
					"answer": "A: For security reasons, you cannot manually change your own vaccination record. Instead, please check the supervisor review box to notify a supervisor to manually review your photo submission. Once clicked, your supervisor will shortly fix your information."

				{
					"question": "Q: My employee accidentally lost their password. How do I recover it? ",
					"answer": "A: Unfortunately, you cannot access an employee's password. To solve this, manually delete the employee's account and create a new one with the same information. This will automatically send an email containing new login information."
				},
				{
					"question": "Q: How do I import a file of employees?",
					"answer": "A: The import file must be a .csv file. More commonly, you can simply create an Excel Spreadsheet with three columns: employee first names, last names, and their email addresses. Then, save it as a .csv file. "
				},
				{
					"question": "Q: I get an error when I try to import an employee list?",
					"answer": "A: Please ensure that your employees' names and email addresses are accurate and correctly formatted. If you run into any further problems, feel free to reach out to us."
				},
				{
					"question": "Q: How do I open the exported status of my employees?",
					"answer": "A: The best way to access it is by opening the file with Microsoft Excel. You may also open it through your device's text editor."
